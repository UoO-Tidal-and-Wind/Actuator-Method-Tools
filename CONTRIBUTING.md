## Code Style and Structure  

This package follows **PEP 8** for clean, maintainable code. Key conventions:  

- **Naming**: `snake_case` for functions/variables, `CamelCase` for classes, `UPPER_CASE` for constants.  
- **Imports**: Absolute imports preferred, relative for internal modules.  
- **Function Design**: Modular, type-hinted, and avoiding mutable default arguments.  
- **Logging**: Uses `logging` instead of print statements for better debugging.  
- **Testing**: `pytest` for unit tests, located in `tests/`.  
- **Documentation**: Google-style docstrings and examples in `examples/`.  
- **Performance**: Vectorized operations with **NumPy**, profiling tools for optimization.
